Visualizing an interesting method for relating two numbers.

Specifically, we find the largest unit to represent two given numbers<br>
(i.e. Greatest Common Divisor using [Euclidean algorithm]).

I'm creating this because years ago this was the light-bulb example that made
really _feel_ the nature of numbers as magnitudes expressed in terms of other
magnitudes (units).
